# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".

#   Absolute: ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
#   Relative: ../../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?

#   cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)

#   Remove/delete the current directory

# 12) What do the following commands do?

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?

#   How do you guys manage to remember all the commands? I'm alos genuinely curious to see how the basic skills we've learned so far will develop into the tools necessary for astro research

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!

#   Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 

i = 1j
print(i ** 4)   # runs sqrt-1 to the power of 4

# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
